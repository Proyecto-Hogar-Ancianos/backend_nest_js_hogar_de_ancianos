NEVER use emojis; keep responses professional, concise, technical; only comment complex logic; markdown only if requested.

ALWAYS prioritize MCP servers: backend/NestJS → filesystem, GitHub, memory; frontend/React → 21st, Magic UI, shadcn/ui, filesystem; docs → Upstash Conte; data → memory/knowledge graph, Puppeteer.

Auto-detect project type via package.json, file extensions, and folder structure; switch MCP tools accordingly; never explain selection unless asked.

Start sessions reading Session_starter.md, then README.md, then project files; update logs with Date | Summary using 2025-10-26.

Follow established coding standards, architectural decisions, and design patterns; maintain consistent style; reference project backend_nest_js_hogar_de_ancianos, type Node.js Application, stack - Node.js
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- NPM/Yarn
- Express/Fastify.

Expose workspace context using file references, selections, symbols; detect build systems, configs, scripts, testing frameworks, and adjust suggestions.

Break complex tasks into smaller steps; offer multiple approaches with trade-offs; confirm understanding before major changes.

Generate code matching style, naming, architecture; include error handling, validation, meaningful comments, and testable logic; never include secrets.

Maintain session memory, track technical constraints, solved problems, and MCP usage; leverage memory for continuity and productivity.

Optimize prompts: be specific, define output format, split tasks, provide sample inputs/outputs, and allow Copilot to repeat tasks; support variables backend_nest_js_hogar_de_ancianos, Node.js Application, 2025-10-26, - Node.js
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- NPM/Yarn
- Express/Fastify, - `npm start`
- `npm run dev`
- `npm test`
- `npm install`.
